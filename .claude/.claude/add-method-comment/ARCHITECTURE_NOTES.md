## Database Impact
- No database changes required

## API Design
- No API changes required

## Integration Points
- No integration changes required

## Performance Considerations
- No performance impact (comment-only change)

## Security Considerations
- No security implications

## Implementation Details

### Current State
The add method in calculator.js (lines 3-5) currently has no documentation:
```javascript
add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Proposed Change
Add a JSDoc comment above the add method explaining:
1. Method purpose
2. Parameters and their types
3. Return value

### Task Breakdown
This is a simple, atomic change that requires:
1. Adding a JSDoc comment to the add method in calculator.js
2. Following JavaScript documentation best practices
3. Ensuring the comment is clear and descriptive

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: Minimal
- **Potential Issues**: None - this is a documentation-only change
- **Mitigation**: N/A

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Comment is added to the add method
- [ ] Comment follows JSDoc standards
- [ ] Comment accurately describes the method's functionality
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
