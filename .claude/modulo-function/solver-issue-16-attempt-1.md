- [ ] Method includes clear comment explaining its purpose
- [ ] All edge cases are properly handled
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covers all scenarios (positive, negative, decimal, edge cases)
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New functionality is fully tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns in calculator.js
- [ ] Method signature matches other calculator methods
- [ ] Error handling is consistent with divide() method pattern
- [ ] Tests follow existing test structure and patterns

## Dependencies
None - this is a self-contained feature addition

## Files Likely to Change
- `calculator.js`
- `test/calculator.test.js`

Feature Branch: feature/modulo-function


## Critical Requirements

### üèóÔ∏è Worktree Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: You are operating in a Git worktree at `/Users/nickschrock/git/simple-calculator-modulo-function`. All commands must be run from this directory.

2. **Understand Dependencies**: Check if this issue depends on others

   - Look for "Depends on #123" or "Blocked by #456" in issue body
   - Verify dependent issues are completed before proceeding

3. **Check for Previous Attempts**: If `1 > 1`, review previous failure feedback in issue comments

### üîß Implementation Process

5. **Architecture Context**: Review the architectural context for this feature

   **Architecture Notes:**

   ```
   # Modulo Function Architecture

## Feature Overview
Add a modulo operator to the Calculator class that computes the remainder of division operations.

## Implementation Strategy
**Single Comprehensive Task**: This feature is implemented as one cohesive task combining the method implementation and comprehensive testing, optimizing for efficiency by avoiding unnecessary issue overhead.

## Technical Design

### Method Signature
```javascript
modulo(a, b) {
  // Returns a % b (remainder of a/b)
}
```

### Key Behaviors
1. **Standard Modulo**: Returns remainder of division (a % b)
2. **Zero Divisor**: Throws error consistent with divide() method
3. **Negative Numbers**: Follows JavaScript % operator semantics
4. **Decimal Support**: Handles floating-point operands

### Error Handling
- Modulo by zero throws descriptive error
- Consistent with existing divide() method pattern

### Testing Strategy
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Positive integer operations
- Negative number handling
- Decimal/floating-point cases
- Zero divisor error case
- Edge cases (0 % n, n % 1, etc.)
- Mathematical properties verification

## Integration Points
- Extends existing Calculator class
- Follows established method patterns
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Uses existing test framework (Jest)

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Simple mathematical operation
- **Well-defined**: JavaScript % operator provides clear behavior model
- **Isolated**: No dependencies on other system components

   ```

   Use this context to:

   - Understand the overall feature architecture and design decisions
   - Follow established patterns and conventions for this feature
   - Ensure your implementation aligns with the broader architectural vision
   - Reference any specific technical requirements or constraints mentioned

6. **Codebase Analysis**:

   - Search for relevant files and patterns
   - Understand existing conventions and patterns
   - Identify files that need modification

7. **Test-Driven Development**:

   - Write failing tests first when applicable
   - Focus on edge cases and error handling
   - Use existing test patterns in the codebase

8. **Implementation**:

   - Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
   - Maintain existing code conventions
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation
   - Add proper TypeScript types (never use `any`)

### üìù Documentation & Tracking

9. **Update Issue Progress**:

   - Check off completed acceptance criteria
   - Add implementation notes as comments
   - Update any relevant task lists

10. **Documentation Updates**:

    - Update README.md files if functionality changes
    - Update CLAUDE.md if patterns change
    - Create/update component documentation

11. **Architecture Notes**:
    Update .claude/modulo-function/ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md with any architectural changes that you may have made in this issue. If no architectural changes have been made, feel free to skip this.

12. **Changelog Entry**:
    Update the changelog with a BRIEF entry of what you changed
    IMPORTANT: remember to be brief and concise
    ```bash
    echo "### Issue #16 - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
    - [Brief description of what was implemented]
    " >> .claude/modulo-function/CHANGELOG.md
    ```

## Multi-Agent Guidelines

- **Atomic Changes**: Keep changes focused and self-contained
- **Clear Interfaces**: Ensure your changes don't break other agents' work
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Other agents depend on your code working correctly
- **Documentation**: Leave clear notes for review agents

### üîÑ Retry Handling

If this is attempt #2 or #3:

- **Review Previous Feedback**: Check issue comments for reviewer feedback
- **Address Specific Concerns**: Focus on the exact issues raised
- **Don't Repeat Mistakes**: Learn from previous attempt failures
- **Ask Questions**: Comment on issue if requirements are unclear

### ‚ö° Performance Considerations

- **Database Migrations**: Coordinate any schema changes carefully
- **API Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- **Build Performance**: Don't introduce expensive build steps

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Ready for Review** when:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linting and type checking pass
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Issue acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR created with clear description

## Emergency Procedures

### üö® If You Get Stuck

1. Comment on the GitHub issue with specific questions
2. Tag relevant team members if architectural guidance needed
3. Create draft PR with current progress and ask for early feedback

### üîß If Tests Fail

1. Run tests locally to understand failures
2. Check if failures are related to your changes
3. Fix failing tests or update them if behavior intentionally changed
4. Don't commit with failing tests

### üèóÔ∏è If Build Fails

1. Check TypeScript errors carefully
2. Ensure all imports are correct
3. Verify package dependencies are up to date
4. Run `pnpm install` if needed
